# Conditional Recurrence Solver
## Overview

This is a recurrence solver based on our following works:

- On Polynomial Expressions with C-Finite Recurrences in Loops with Nested Nondeterministic Branches (CAV 2024)
- Solving Conditional Linear Recurrences for Program Verification: The Periodic Case (OOPSLA 2023)

Besides the aforementioned works,
the solver now supports computing closed-form solutions to multivariate functions.

This documentation will be updated as soon as possible.
