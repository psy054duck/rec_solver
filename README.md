# Conditional Recurrence Solver
## Overview

This is a recurrence solver based on our following works:

- On Polynomial Expressions with C-Finite Recurrences in Loops with Nested Nondeterministic Branches (CAV 2024)
- Solving Conditional Linear Recurrences for Program Verification: The Periodic Case (OOPSLA 2023)

## Current Progress
The two aforementioned works are done.
We are developing other features.
For example, function summarization for multivariate functions.
The parser is out of date, which will be updated soon.
